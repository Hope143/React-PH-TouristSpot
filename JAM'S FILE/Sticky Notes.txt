(pag oo proceed ako pg hindi end call)

now ask ko siya 
Me : are you still interested with inquiry removal

Cust : Yes

Me : Alright, now what we usually do is we do credit analysis to get to know how many inquiries you have on your account. where did the inquiries came from, and how long those inquiries have been on the account. From there we get to know how much we could offer you the service.

(How do you answer if client says "I already have CM"Client : I already have CM)

Me : Perfect, however we can only use IDIQ since this is what integrates with our system. No worries, your sign up today is just for your analysis right after it you can cancel

(kung di sila interested then di tlga sila papayag let go) 

Kung may tanong sila na alam mo sagutin mo lang kung hindi mo na alam ang nag iisang sagot lang dyan ay **that's gonna be discussed in your credit analysis***
