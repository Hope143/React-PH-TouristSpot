WHAT IS YOUR GREATEST WEAKNESSES/ STRENGTH
To be honest, this is one of the toughest question that I've been asking to myself before this interview...

*My greastest weeknesses 
for me is being detail-oriented when it comes to task is too much. There are time that I overwork some tasks, which was not needed, without realizing that there are still some tasks that needs to be done.
I'm striving to improve this area without disregarding the quantity of the task that will given to me. By checking myself regulary to monitor my improvements and by setting goals to meet the metrics. These will help me to focus and to work efficiently with right amount of time.

*My strenght. for me is being a soft-hearted person when it comes to my job I need to understand the client and take time to listen to them in that way they can feel that you are really listening to them and you are interested to what they say. With that they feel that as a costumer service, I can provide the assist they want and I also have can get a great feedback from them.

WHERE DO YOU SEE YOURSELF 5 YEARS FROM NOW:
I can see myself 5 years from now working to this company and that time I do a lot of things that can help my family, such as my brother graduate and my mom have her own surplus business with all of my help and of course by the help of my job.


WHY SHOULD I HIRE YOU INSTEAD OF OTHER APPLICANTS
I am the person who is commited to the company that will hire me and I can say that my experience is the different from other applicants. You should hire me because I know how to deal to this kind of job.

CAN YOU TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR PREVIOUS JOB:
I work at Grandteton professional for 2 year, Big boy funding for 4 months and now I work as a appointment setter of Spotlight cash buyers for 3 months now. My job is to call the potential people and ask them if they are interested to apply for a loan. I'm also the one responsible for checking it if they are qualify for the specific loan they applied for. And then after that, I will set them an appointment to my boss.

WHY DID YOU LEFT TO YOUR PREV. COMPANY:
I am actually not the one who left the company. At the first company, Ive work. There is a an issue to the country which the company located and also the CEO wants to fired all the filipino workers, that time they left us without any salary. The second company I work its also the same there is an issue with the employees that need to float and will call if they need us again. And again they left us but now they give our salary.

WHY ALORICA:
I choose Alorica because I also tried to apply for this company before and I failed it. Ever since when I dont have experience in any work I really want to apply Alorica because I can say that it was one of the successful company in the philippines and I believe that it can help me a lot to all things.

WHAT IS CUSTOMER SERVICE:
Customer service is the assist and provide by the company to those people who buy and use the product or sevices


WHAT IS CUSTOMER SERVICE SATISFACTION:
The satisfaction of customer services is when they provide what really needs of the client such a assistance and product services. 

WHAT IS BPO / CALL CENTER:
BPO stands for BUSINESS PROCESS OUTSOURCING whichs means is the act of third party vendor or service provider. 
BPO CALL CENTER is a team or agents who handle incoming and outgoing costumer calls for other businesses.
