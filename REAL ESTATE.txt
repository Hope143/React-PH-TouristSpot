E: Hello may I speak to Andrew
Client: Yes, this is him.

ME: Good day this is Jam , I’m calling in regards to your property at 7615 Waverly St at Pittsburgh.
Client: Okay, what about it?

ME: Yeah, So Reason I’m calling is because we’re actually looking to buy in the area and
wanted to see if you might be open to a cash offer?


 If YES: Ok great! Do you mind if I ask a few questions about the property so that we
can give an accurate offer?

Me: Ok, so what’s going on with the house, can you tell me about it?

 What kind of improvements have you done within the last 5 years?
(Let the seller open up about the condition)
• kitchen? Have you done any work to it in the past 5 years?
• roof? Any problems?
• AC and Heater? Any problems?
• Is the property vacant or rented?
Are the tenants on a month to month lease agreement or yearly?

Alright, well it sounds like it’s a decent house, what is the reason why you want to sell it?

If we’re able to close on your time frame, pay for all the fees, all the
closing costs, and purchase the house for cash in AS IS condition, what’s
the least amount of money you would sell for? Do you have any price on your mind for the property?

Ok, sounds good. I’ll go ahead and have my manager run the numbers and get back to you within today. Just to make sure, this is the best number to reach you at, correct? Ok great. Well, Andrew I a ppreciate your time, stay safe and have a great day. Goodbye!
